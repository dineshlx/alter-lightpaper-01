## What is Metaverse?

A metaverse is **a form of mixed reality with a combination of augmented and virtual reality**. Metaverse will introduce digital elements in the real world. Metaverse will support 3-D virtual spaces. 3D spaces in the virtual world will let you socialize, learn, collaborate and play in ways that go beyond what we can imagine.

It also consists of a combination of social media, online gaming, marketplaces, and cryptocurrencies to allow users to interact & experience virtually.

Metaverse is the ecosystem to next-gen human evolution and **ALTER is the portal to Metaverse**.

However, it’s clearly a concept that we’ve been building towards since the emergence of the internet, social media, virtual reality, and early attempts at creating shared digital environments such as **Second Life.**

Zuckerberg has described his conception of the metaverse as an "**internet that you're inside of, rather than just looking at**," which gives us some clues about how he is approaching it. The reason we’re having a serious conversation about metaverses now is that several key technology trends have reached a level of maturity where they will be up to the task. One of these is certainly a virtual reality.

Facebook has invested heavily in VR since acquiring headset manufacturer Oculus in 2014. It has made no secret of the fact that it doesn’t see the future of VR as being confined to the “walled garde**n” gaming and educational environments** where it’s most commonly found today.
