## What is Metaverse?

The origin of the **metaverse** has been traced to Neal Stephenson’s science fiction novel _Snow Crash_, referring to a digital world way above the current analog world. Metaverse emanates from a portmanteau of two words, “meta”, which refers to “**beyond**”, and “verse”, which denotes “**universe**.”

In layman’s language, metaverse would translate to a universe beyond the **physical world**. In technology, the metaverse is a term that describes a **computer-mediated universe**, free from the limits of the metaphysical and spiritual domains of the physical world.

Metaverse is described as a **future Internet technology** that transcends the current technological limits, which takes the interaction of the next generation’s users to another level. Metaverse allows users to interact among themselves and with software applications in a **3-dimensional space (3D) using avatars**. Metaverse combines multiple aspects of digital reality, including social media, AR, VR, online gaming, and cryptocurrencies, to facilitate virtual interaction.

Basically, the metaverse is a “**shared virtual environment that people access via the Internet**”. The technology creates a set of virtual spaces where people can immerse themselves through holograms/avatars to make it feel like they are in the same physical space. A metaverse will rely on multiple technologies, including fully immersive **3D spaces, VR, and AR**, to create this sense of presence. The overall goal is to tap the opportunities that the Internet offers to give users an experience of interacting in person. This will be a great milestone in using the persistence of **virtual worlds to offer multiple users in different physical locations** a platform to interact in real-time for varied purposes.

Metaverse is the ecosystem to next-gen human evolution and **ALTER is the portal to Metaverse**.

However, it’s clearly a concept that we’ve been building towards since the emergence of the internet, social media, virtual reality, and early attempts at creating shared digital environments such as **Second Life.**
